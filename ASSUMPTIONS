ASSUMPTIONS

For A-Bin, we are assuming that people come looking out for good and safe environment for hanging out or for spending quality time along with finding food spots at a reasonable rate.  

 

For C-Bin, we assume that people are invited to see the culture, history and heritage of a beach as well as be curious enough to know about the different ways we are implementing for waste disposal.

 

For E-Bin, it is purely based on the assumption that the experience of a virtual world is not something easily available to people at an affordable rate and these arenâ€™t a common concept in our country. So it will be able to provide people with a good exposure to the depths  of underwater world at a reasonable or affordable price.
